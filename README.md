# (TF2) Youngest Point Prioritisation
This is just a simple plugin I wrote that changes flamethrower damage calculcations so that the youngest point is prioritised instead of the oldest. This was per request of [some friend of mine](https://www.youtube.com/@WhistlingPyro) and I figured why not.

You could also just memory match a few things but this is less annoying to work with if offsets change.
